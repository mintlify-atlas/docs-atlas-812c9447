## Why Better Svelte Email?

Existing Svelte email solutions have significant limitations:

- **svelte-email** hasn't been updated in over 2 years
- **svelte-email-tailwind** suffers from stability issues and maintaining it is not sustainable anymore

Better Svelte Email is a complete rewrite inspired by [React Email](https://react.email/), providing the rock-solid foundation your email infrastructure needs. It brings the simplicity, reliability, and feature richness of React Email to the Svelte ecosystem.

## Key Features

### Complete Tailwind Support

Better Svelte Email transforms Tailwind classes into inline styles that work across all email clients:

- All Tailwind v4 utilities
- Custom Tailwind classes (`bg-[#fff]`, `my:[40px]`)
- Dynamic Tailwind classes (`class={someVar}`)
- Responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:`)
- Custom Tailwind configurations
- Custom CSS injection for app theme integration

### Email-Safe HTML

Automatically converts your Svelte components to HTML that works reliably across all major email clients:

- Inline styles for maximum compatibility
- Media queries injected into `<head>` for responsive design
- XHTML 1.0 Transitional DOCTYPE
- Table-based layouts with accessible markup

### Rich Component Library

Pre-built components with sensible defaults for building email layouts:

```svelte
import {
  Html, Head, Body, Preview,
  Container, Section, Row, Column,
  Heading, Text, Button, Link,
  Img, Hr
} from 'better-svelte-email';
```

All components forward regular HTML attributes, merge inline styles, and include props tuned for email-friendly rendering.

### Plain Text Generation

Generate plain text versions of your emails automatically for better deliverability and accessibility:

```typescript
import { toPlainText } from 'better-svelte-email/render';

const plainText = toPlainText(html);
```

## Requirements

Better Svelte Email requires:

- **Svelte** >= v5.14.3
- **Tailwind CSS** >= v4 (optional, but recommended)

<Note>
  For older Svelte versions, you can use [`svelte-email-tailwind`](https://github.com/steveninety/svelte-email-tailwind).
</Note>

## Quick Example

Here's a simple welcome email to give you a taste of what's possible:

```svelte
<script>
  import {
    Html, Head, Body, Preview,
    Container, Section, Text, Button
  } from 'better-svelte-email';

  let { name = 'there' } = $props();
</script>

<Html>
  <Head />
  <Body class="bg-zinc-100">
    <Preview preview="Welcome to our platform" />
    <Container class="m-8 mx-auto max-w-lg rounded-2xl bg-white p-8">
      <Section class="mx-auto text-center">
        <Text class="text-2xl font-bold text-zinc-900">
          Welcome {name}!
        </Text>
        <Text class="mt-3 text-zinc-600">
          Thanks for joining us. We're excited to have you on board.
        </Text>
        <Button
          href="https://example.com/get-started"
          pX={24}
          pY={14}
          class="mt-6 rounded-lg bg-orange-600 text-white"
        >
          Get Started
        </Button>
